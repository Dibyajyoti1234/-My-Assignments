A probability density function (PDF) is a function that describes the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable to take on a given value. For example, if we measure the height of people in a population, the PDF would describe how likely it is for someone to be a certain height. The integral of a PDF over an interval gives the probability that a random variable falls within that interval"
